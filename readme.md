# Ticket Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This Ticket Sales Analysis Dashboard is a Streamlit-based web application designed to provide insightful analytics for ticket sales data. It offers a user-friendly interface for uploading CSV files containing ticket sales information and generates various visualizations and summaries to help understand sales trends, ticket types, and revenue patterns.

## Features

1. **Data Upload**: Users can upload CSV files containing ticket sales data.
2. **Summary Statistics**: Provides summaries for the last 30, 60, and 90 days, including sales trends, tickets sold, and average prices.
3. **Flexible Time Period Analysis**: Allows breakdown of data by day, week, month, year, or custom date range.
4. **Interactive Visualizations**: 
   - Sales and tickets sold over time
   - Ticket type breakdown
5. **Detailed Data Table**: Displays a sortable and filterable table of sales data.

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: The application uses pandas to read and process the uploaded CSV file.
2. **Data Processing**: Various functions filter and aggregate the data based on user-selected time periods and metrics.
3. **Visualization**: Plotly is used to create interactive charts and graphs.
4. **User Interface**: Streamlit provides the web interface, allowing for easy interaction and data exploration.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ticket-sales-analysis.git
   cd ticket-sales-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py

## How to Use

1. Launch the application and use the file uploader to select your CSV file containing ticket sales data.
2. The dashboard will automatically generate summaries and visualizations based on the uploaded data.
3. Use the dropdown menus and date selectors to filter and analyze data for specific time periods.
